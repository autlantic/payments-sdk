## Two ways to integrate

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **npm SDK** | Node backends, in-process sandbox, full control |
| **Hosted HTTP API** | Any stack (curl, mobile, PHP), API key only |

```bash
npm install @autlantic/payments-recurring
```

```ts
import { AutlanticBilling } from "@autlantic/payments-recurring";

// Hosted: set AUTLANTIC_BILLING_API_KEY to abk_test_… or abk_live_…
const billing = AutlanticBilling.fromEnv();

// Or local in-process demo:
// const billing = AutlanticBilling.sandbox({ merchantId: "mer_demo" });

const { url } = await billing.createPaymentLink({
  merchantRefPrefix: "invoice",
  payoutAddressEvm: "0xYourMerchantWallet…",
  amountUsdc: 42,
  description: "Consulting",
});
// Share url or QR → /checkout/link/:id
```

See [Getting started](/guide/getting-started) for subscriptions, one-time pay, and payment links.
